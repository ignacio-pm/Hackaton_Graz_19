# Hackaton_Graz_19

Program developed in a 24 hours Hackaton sponsored by Infineon in Graz. The objective of the competition was to improve the drone software by adding new features. The program is a basic sketch using the OpenCV library of a program to detect a line in the floor in order to the drone to complete an autonomous route. 

The rest of the time of the hackaton was used to design and fabricate in a 3D printer new propellers for the drone and to clean and improve the software of the drone.
